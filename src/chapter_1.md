# Introduction

The Hyper Hyper Space is both:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A framework to create and reason about distributed collaborative platforms.

and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A software library that implements such a framework.

HHS-based applications are fully distributed. Each person using the app has running, in their own computer, a full copy of the software that powers the application, and a copy of the data as well.

Our framework provides building blocks to help all these computers organize into ad-hoc mesh networks, and then securely synchronize the information they each have.
